<h2 align="center">Time Series Motif Discovery</h2>
<p>

Motif Discovery consists of identifying repeated patterns and locating their occurrences in a time series without prior knowledge about their shape or location.
%Discovering repeated patterns, known as motif, and their occurrences in a time series is a fundamental exploratory task with relevant applications in various domains. 
In practice motif discovery faces several data-related challenges which has lead to numerous definition of the motif discovery problem and algorithms partially encompassing these challenges. 
%Although this task has received a great deal of attention, there is no consensus on the formal definition of motifs, and to our knowledge there has never been a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the methods proposed in the literature.
In this repo, we provide a set of real time series labeled specifically for the purpose of motif discovery, as well as a set of algorithms carefully chosen to best represent the litterature spectrum.
We also provide an analysis of strengths and weaknesses of these selected algorithms. The analysis follows research questions that we have identified on the basis of challenges encounter in practice.
Our experimental results should provide a practical guide for selecting the most suitable algorithm for motif discovery and open new research directions.
