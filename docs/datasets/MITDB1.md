# MITDB1 

The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database [Goldberger et al. 2000] contains 48 half-hour recordings of two-channel ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) sampled at 360Hz. Cardiologists annotated the heartbeats according to 19 categories. We divide all recordings into a time series of 1 minute and keep only the first channel. We selected time series of healthy subjects that contains only normal heartbeats and randomly selected 100 time series.
