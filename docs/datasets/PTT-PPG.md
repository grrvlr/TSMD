# ptt-ppg

Pule-Transit-Time photoplethysmogram (PPG) dataset [Mehrgardt et al. 2022] consists of time series recorded with multiple sensors (sampled at 500Hz) from healthy subjects performing physical activities. The annotated motifs are heartbeats. We randomly select 100 40-second-long signals from the first channel of the PPG during the “run” activity.
