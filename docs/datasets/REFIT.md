# REFIT

This dataset [Murray et al. 2017] provides aggregate and individual appliance load curves at 8-second sampling intervals from 20 houses. We selected 10 houses and aggregated recordings of the appliances available: dishwasher, washing machine, and tumble dryer. The recordings were down-sampled to 32-second intervals and divided into time series of one week. We kept 10 time series for each house in which the appliances were not used simultaneously. It resulted in a 100 univariate time series dataset with a maximum of 3 different motifs.
