# JIGSAW

The time series of this dataset [Gao et al. 2014] are recorded from the DaVinci Surgical System. Each time series contains 76 dimensions. Each dimension corresponds to a sensor
(with an acquisition rate of 30 Hz). The sensors are divided into two groups: patient-side manipulators (**JIGSAWSlave**), and master tool manipulators (**JIGSAWMaster**). The recorded time series corresponds to surgeons performing a suture that can be decomposed into 11 gestures. Each gesture corresponds to a motif that can be repeated multiple times within the same time series. Overall, we selected 23 time series (from different sensors) for JIGSAWMaster and 32 time series for JIGSAWSlave.
